 UX Consultation and Design

Layout foundation complete. Need logo, cta inspiration and buttons.

Mobile and other responsive features. Page styling and layout. Removed jquery because function changes class name instead of changing attributes of a class.

Fixed some mobile glitches and some bugs that didn't get fixed during pull request.
