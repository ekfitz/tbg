Layout foundation complete. Need logo, cta inspiration and buttons.

Mobile and other responsive features. Page styling and layout. Removed jquery because function changes class name instead of changing attributes of a class.

Fixed some mobile glitches and some bugs that didn't get fixed during pull request.

Added better mobile css and made links hover to accent color.

Add second page. This is a more detailed description of work flow. Click on circles to be directed to another page.
